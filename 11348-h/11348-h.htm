      CLARENDON HOUSE, PICCADILLY.

    <p>
      The virtuous and uncompromising chancellor, the Earl of
      Clarendon, had a splendid mansion facing the upper end of St.
      James's-street, on the site of the present Grafton-street. Of
      this princely pile, the above is an accurate engraving. It
      was built by Clarendon with the stone intended for the
      rebuilding of St. Paul's. "He purchased the materials," says
      Pennant, "but a nation soured with an unsuccessful war, with
      fire, and with pestilence, imputed everything as a crime to
      this great and envied character; his enemies called it
      Dunkirk House, calumniating him with having built it with the
      money arising from the sale of that town, which had just
      before been given up to the French, for a large sum, by his
      Master."
    </p>
    <p>
      It is true that Clarendon built this mansion in a season of
      discontent; but so sensible was he of his vanity and
      imprudence in building so large a house, and of the envy it
      drew upon him, that he afterwards apologized for the act;
      which he declares, so far exceeded the proposed expense, as
      to add greatly to the embarrassment of his affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      This mansion cost &pound;50,000. and 300 men were employed in
      the building. It was purchased from his lordship by George
      Monk, Duke of Albemarle, and afterwards by another nobleman,
      inferior indeed in abilities, but not inferior in virtues. In
      1670, James, Duke of Ormond, resided at Clarendon House; and
      on his way thither, he was one day dragged out of his coach
      by the infamous Blood and his associates, who intended to
      hang his Grace at Tyburn, in revenge for justice done, under
      his administration in Ireland, on some of their companions.
      "This refinement in revenge," says Pennant, "saved the duke's
      life; he had leisure to disengage himself from the villain on
      horseback, to whom he was tied; by which time he was
      discovered by his servants, and rescued from death."
    </p>
    <p>
      The original of our Engraving was copied from a rare print,
      which, in the year 1790, was in the collection of Thomas
      Allen, Esq. Appended to the former is a section, showing the
      relative situation of Clarendon House, which was taken from a
      map of London (supposed to be unique) in an illustrated
      <i>Clarendon's</i> <span class="pagenum"><a id="page290"
      name="page290"></a>[pg 290]</span> <i>History</i>, in the
      possession of John Charles Crowle, Esq. By the section, the
      entrance-gate to the court-yard of the house appears to have
      been in Piccadilly, in a direct line with St. James's Street,
      and the grounds to have extended to Bruton Street at the
      back, where there was likewise a communication. The site of
      the front gate is now, therefore, the commencement of
      <i>Albemarle Street</i>, named after one of the distinguished
      occupants of Clarendon House.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding the revolutions of time and fashion in this
      quarter, the illustrious name of the founder of Clarendon
      House is still preserved in the "<i>Clarendon Hotel</i>,"
      which occupies a portion of the original ground already
      described. One of the changes is, that instead of the
      Chancellor meditating upon his dismissal from office, which
      his very virtues and stately dignity, and a weak king, and a
      more wicked and envious faction had brought about,&mdash;we
      have well-living twos and fours hob-nobbing over
      Chateau-Margaux, or yielding to the delightful inspirations
      of Ay Champagne. Not a few more of the good things of this
      great town are assembled near the same spot. Albemarle Street
      has many first-rate hotels, and two handsome club-houses;
      while on the Bond Street side of the quadrangle are two or
      three extensive libraries, an immense porcelain repository,
      and a score of fashionable <i>artistes</i>. What idle
      delights are all these compared with the wisdom and virtue
      which once dwelt on the same spot. But had Clarendon lived to
      see Crockford's splendid subscription-house rise after a
      golden shower, in St. James's Street, (and this he might have
      done from the front-windows of Clarendon House) he would,
      perhaps, have given us an extra volume of <i>Essays</i>. We
      would that he <i>had</i> so lived, if only that his sublime
      truths might thus nave been multiplied for the good of
      mankind, if not for the weak heads of St. James's Street.

      THE COSMOPOLITE.

    <hr />
    <h3>
      THE TIMES NEWSPAPER.
    </h3>
    <p>
      We are not about to write an advertisement for this
      advertised of all advertisers&mdash;nor to talk of its square
      feet&mdash;its crowded broadside&mdash;or the myriads of
      letters that make it resemble a sea of animalculae. We are
      content to leave all the pride of its machinery to Messrs.
      Applegath and Cowper, and the clang of its engine to the
      peaceful purlieus of Printing-house Square. Yet these are
      interesting items in the advancement of science, and in the
      history of mankind; for whether taken mechanically or
      morally, the <i>Times</i> is, without exception, the
      newspaper of all newspapers, "the observed of all
      <i>observers</i>" and altogether, the most extraordinary
      production of this or any other age.
    </p>
    <p>
      But we are more anxious to reach what may be called the
      philosophy of a newspaper&mdash;that broad volume of human
      life, in which "the follies, vices, and consequent miseries
      of multitudes are displayed." To prove this, only let the
      reader glance over the twenty-four columns of a Times
      newspaper, and attempt a calculation of the many thousand
      events that spring from and are connected with their
      contents. Yet this sheet is but as it were a day in the life
      of man&mdash;a mere thread of the mingled yarn of his
      existence&mdash;and 313 such sheets, or 1,252 such folios
      make but a year of his history. The subject is too vast and
      comprehensive for continued contemplation, for it is like all
      other wheels of vicissitude; we become giddy by looking too
      steadfastly on its twinings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us take one side of any recent <i>Times</i>
      newspaper&mdash;say that of <i>Thursday last</i>&mdash;and
      attempt something like an abstract of its <i>memorabilia</i>.
      This may appear for us a toilsome task, but if the reader be
      not fatigued also, our time will not be misspent. Begin "at
      the beginning" with the old English title, broken by the
      royal arms&mdash;like a blocking-course; and the No. and date
      in a sort of typographical entablature. The first side is

      Thus, we start, and not unappropriately, with notices of
      vessels <i>to sail</i> for India and the new settlement on
      <i>Swan River</i>. What temptations for adventure and
      avarice&mdash;what associations of industry and
      indolence&mdash;luxury and squalid misery&mdash;do these
      announcements create in the reflective mind. The nabob in his
      chintz&mdash;the speculator with his last hundred&mdash;and
      the half-starved agriculturist&mdash;are but sorry portraits
      beside the class to whom the next notice is
      addressed.&mdash;Packets to Calais, Dieppe, and
      Margate&mdash;necessity on her last leg, and luxury on the
      fantastic toe&mdash;the wasted mind and famished visage
      beside hoyden mirth and bloated luxury. Then the South
      American Mining Association Deed "lies for
      signature:"&mdash;what a relief in this sheet of
      <i>chiaro-scuro</i>&mdash;a kind of tinsel to set off its
      grave parts, with gold dust enough to blind half its readers.
      To this little flash of golden light succeeds
      shade&mdash;Chancery and creditors' notices&mdash;proving
      debts and consciences&mdash;followed by civil contracts for
      Bridewell and building a Lunatic Asylum in Kent. The
      association is too obvious, and verily, the maker-up of the
      Times newspaper is a Hogarth in his way; for what Hogarth did
      with pencil and brush, he does with metallic types. Next is a
      Saw Mill to be sold cheap, constructed for the express
      purpose of being sent to the Swan River settlement&mdash;how
      fortunate&mdash;for surely any idle wight would make his way
      with such assistance, especially as the machine is "on
      improved principles." <i>Luxury</i>
      again&mdash;paper-hangings, French lamps, and French
      roses&mdash;<i>necessity</i> again&mdash;Money on mortgage,
      and bills discounted: how obvious the connexion&mdash;the
      very cause and effect&mdash;the lamps will not burn without
      oil, and the roses will not bloom without money&mdash;at
      least they will only waste their fragrance in the desert air
      of the nursery-ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>second column</i> begins with a solicitor's inquiry
      for a person long unheard of, who, if alive, "may hear of
      somewhat very considerably to his advantage"&mdash;any person
      proving his death, shall be rewarded. Next is a notice from
      the City Chamber Court of Stralsund, of a man who has been
      missing twenty years, and unless he informs the court of his
      existence on or before Lady-day, 1830, he will be declared
      dead&mdash;poor fellow&mdash;yet how many would rejoice at
      such an opportunity of escaping from their worldly cares.
      Next comes a little string of Anniversaries of
      Charities&mdash;followed by Exhibitions of the Fine
      Arts&mdash;had their <span class="pagenum"><a id="page292"
      name="page292"></a>[pg 292]</span> position been reversed,
      the effect would have been better; for fine painting prepares
      the heart for acts of benevolence, and kindleth all its best
      feelings. Portraits of the Rev. Matthew Wilks and Pope Pius
      VII. (the latter a splendid mezzotinto from Sir T. Lawrence's
      picture) are followed by a "<i>Speaking</i> French Grammar,"
      a very good companion for any Englishman about to visit the
      continent; for with many, their stock of French does not last
      out their cash. Next is fourteen years of the Morning Post to
      be sold&mdash;a bargain for a fashionable novelist, and in
      fact, a complete stock-in-trade for any court or town Adonis;
      a perfect vocabulary of fashion, detailing the rise and
      progress of all the fashionable arts since the
      peace&mdash;the gazette appointments and
      disappointments&mdash;and elopements and <i>faux pas</i>,
      sufficient for all the comedy-writers of the present
      century&mdash;the respective claims of Spanish Refugees and
      Spitalfields Weavers&mdash;charitable concerts and opera
      benefits&mdash;and all the lumber and light artillery of the
      <i>grand monde</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>third column</i> is almost entirely occupied by
      "Wanted" advertisements and we had resolved to pass over all
      their "Wants;" had not some of them occurred to us as rather
      singular, even in these times of general distress. The first
      of these is for a respectable middle-aged woman, as lady's
      maid&mdash;"to understand dress-making, millinery,
      hair-dressing, getting-up fine linen, and to be useful and
      obliging." All this is reasonable enough; but mark the
      inducement: "a clever person fond of the country, and who can
      bear confinement, will find this a comfortable situation!"
      "This is too much." Another is for a butler and a valet, to
      "undertake the care and responsibility of a numerous family:"
      another is a young man for "a situation in any shop or
      warehouse, not particular what:" another of "a nurse, who can
      cut and make children's dresses, and instruct them in reading
      and spelling;" a school-assistant "to fill the second desk,"
      &amp;c. Next come a few characteristics of a scientific
      age&mdash;as patent trouser-straps, to "prevent the dirt
      getting between the strap and the boot, &amp;c.;" and patent
      springs for waistcoat backs&mdash;to cause the clothes to fit
      well to the shape, &amp;c.&mdash;and, above all, a
      legitimate, scientific <i>Diaphane</i> parasol.
    </p>
    <p>
      The "Wants" are resumed in the <i>fourth column</i>. One is a
      young man to be able to walk well; "it is immaterial what he
      has been accustomed to."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the fourth column we find "a family grave to be sold,
      unused for nearly 50 years at that period, but partly
      occupied. <i>To save trouble</i>, price 25<i>l</i>." Another
      advertisement&mdash;"to small capitalists" is a perfect
      puzzle; for the advertiser will not describe the "ready-money
      concern" to be disposed of, but says, "the principal article
      of sale is what is consumed, either in a greater or less
      degree, by almost every individual." Next is a
      tallowchandler's business in a situation which "will command
      an extensive trade immediately the new Fleet Market is
      erected"&mdash;rather anticipatory, to be sure. Another,
      "worthy of notice," offers for 260 guineas, seven houses,
      which cost 800 in building&mdash;a tolerable speculation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>last column</i> commences with a fine brown gelding,
      (like most friends) parted with for no fault, free from vice,
      although, "a <i>trial</i> will be granted." Another announces
      for sale, several "<i>bays</i>, greys, roans, <i>creams</i>,
      and <i>duns</i>:" a chaise "parted with for no other fault
      than the present owner having purchased a four-wheeled one;"
      and "a house near the church, commanding extensive and
      pleasing prospects."
    </p>
    <p>
      The fourth folio, or side of the paper, is nearly filled with
      advertisements of <i>sales by auction</i>, a single glance at
      which would convince us of the instability of human affairs,
      even if we did not read in one corner, of a theatrical
      wardrobe, containing five splendid new court dresses, trimmed
      with gold and silver (except the pockets,) and 52 very fine
      wigs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inner, or second and third folios of the paper, present
      still finer studies for our reflection. The eye almost
      instinctively lights on the "Foreign Papers," detailing the
      progress of war and the balance of power&mdash;Francfort
      Fair, and English manufactures. Below is the well-known
      graphic relief&mdash;a clock, and two opened and one closed
      book, with "The Times"&mdash;past and future, decorated with
      oak and laurel. Then come the theatrical announcements
      teeming with novelty and attraction, which stand like the
      sauces, savoury dishes, and sweetmeats of the day's repast.

      MANNERS &amp; CUSTOMS OF ALL NATIONS.
    </h2>

    <h3>
      MAY DAY.
    </h3>
    <p>
      It would seem that among our Pagan ancestors, before the
      introduction of Christianity, the <i>first day of May</i> was
      the great festival in honour of the sun, and that fires were
      then kindled and rejoicings made, in honour of that great
      luminary. The first day of May is still called <i>Beltan</i>,
      or <i>Baal-tein</i>, "the fire of Baal." In some parts of the
      country the shepherds still make festivals of milk and eggs
      on that day, but the custom is rapidly declining. In the
      Highlands the festival is still continued with singular
      ceremonies. On Beltan day all the boys in a township or
      hamlet meet in the moors; they cut a table in the green sod,
      of a round figure, by casting a trench in the ground of such
      circumference as to hold the whole company; they kindle a
      fire, and dress a meal of eggs and milk of the consistence of
      a custard; and then knead a cake of oatmeal, which is toasted
      at the embers against a stone. After the custard is eaten up,
      they divide the cake into as many portions, similar in size
      and shape, as there are persons in the company. They then
      daub over one of these portions with charcoal until it is
      perfectly black; they put all the bits of the cake into a
      bonnet; when each of the company, blindfolded, draws out a
      portion. He who holds the bonnet is entitled to the last bit.
      Whoever draws the black piece is the devoted person to be
      sacrificed to Baal, whose favour they mean to implore in
      rendering the season productive. There is little doubt but
      that such inhuman sacrifices were once offered in this
      country as well as in the east; although the act of sacrifice
      is now dispensed with, the devoted person being only
      compelled to leap three times through the flames, with which
      the ceremony of the festival is closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      That the Caledonians paid a superstitious respect to the sun,
      as was the practice among many other nations, is evident, not
      only from the sacrifice of Beltan, but from many other
      circumstances. When a Highlander goes to bathe, or to drink
      water out of a consecrated fountain, he must always approach
      by going round the place from east to west on the south side,
      in imitation of the apparent diurnal motion of the sun. When
      the dead are laid in the earth, the grave is approached by
      going round in the same manner. The bride is conducted to her
      future spouse in the presence of the minister; and the glass
      goes round in company in the course of the sun. This is
      called in Gaelic, going round in the right or lucky way; the
      opposite course is the wrong or unlucky way.

    <h3>
      ABORIGINES OF VAN DIEMAN'S LAND.
    </h3>
    <p>
      So little is known of these children of nature, and still
      less has been done to gain any knowledge of them, that not
      much can be offered as to their present numbers or condition.
      From what I have seen and read, the natives of Van Dieman's
      Land are unlike any other Indians, either in features, their
      mode of living, hunting, &amp;c. There are many hundreds of
      people who have lived for years in the colony, and yet have
      never seen a native. ... The features of these people are any
      thing but pleasing: a large flat nose, with immense nostrils;
      lips particularly thick; a wide mouth, with a tolerably good
      set of teeth; the hair long and woolly, which, as if to
      confer additional beauty, is besmeared with red clay (similar
      to our red ochre) and grease. Their limbs are badly
      proportioned; the women appear to be generally better formed
      than the men. Their only covering is a few kangaroo skins,
      rudely stitched, and thrown over the shoulders; but more
      frequently they appear in a state of nudity; indeed, so
      little knowledge have they of decency or comfort, that they
      never avail themselves of the purposes for which apparel is
      given to them. Lieut. Collins, in his account of the natives
      of New South Wales, describes their marriage ceremonies as
      being most barbarous and brutal; and I have also heard from
      individuals who have visited New South Wales, that it is not
      uncommon to see a poor woman almost beaten to death by her
      lover, previous to his marrying her. From the shyness of the
      natives of Van Dieman's Land, and the constant warfare that
      has been carried on between them and the remote
      stock-keepers, (which is not likely to render them more
      familiar,) I have never been able to ascertain whether there
      is any trace of religion among
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page294" name="page294"></a>[pg
      294]</span> them, or if they have the slightest idea of a
      Supreme Being. I believe, and it is generally supposed, they
      have not. It is but fair to remark, however, that nothing has
      been done for them; the few that can speak a little English,
      only curse and swear, and this they catch up very readily
      from the different convicts they meet with.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      There are but few instances of any native having entirely
      forsaken his tribe, however young he may have been taken
      away; they appear to dislike any thing in the shape of
      labour, although, if they take to cattle, they are, beyond
      any thing, quick in tracing and finding those lost. So acute
      is their power of discrimination, that they have been known
      to trace the footsteps of bush-rangers over mountains and
      rocks; and, although the individual they have been in pursuit
      of has walked into the sides of the river as if to cross it,
      to elude the vigilance of his pursuers, and has swam some
      distance down and crossed when convenient, yet nothing can
      deceive them. Indeed, so remarkable is their discernment,
      that if but the slightest piece of moss on a rock has been
      disturbed by footsteps, they will instantly detect it. The
      aborigines of this island have no appointed place or
      situation to live in; they roam about at will, followed by a
      pack of dogs, of different sorts and sizes, but which are
      used principally for hunting the kangaroo, oppossum,
      bandicoot, &amp;c. They are passionately fond of their dogs;
      so much so, that the females are frequently known to suckle a
      favourite puppy instead of the child. They rarely ever move
      at night, but encircle themselves round a large fire, and
      sleep in a sitting posture, with their heads between their
      knees. So careless are they of their children, that it is not
      uncommon to see boys grown up with feet exhibiting the loss
      of a toe or two, having, when infants, been dropped into the
      fire by the mother. The children are generally carried (by
      the women) astride across the shoulders, in a careless
      manner. They live entirely by hunting, and do not fish so
      much, or use the canoe, as in New South Wales, although the
      women are tolerably expert divers; the craw-fish and oyster,
      if immediately on the coast, are their principal food.
      Oppossums and kangaroos may be said to be their chief
      support; the latter is as delicious a treat to an epicure, as
      the former is the reverse. The manner of cooking their
      victuals is by throwing it on the fire, merely to singe off
      the hair; they eat voraciously, and are very little removed
      from the brute creation as to choice of food; entrails,
      &amp;c. sharing the same chance as the choicest parts. They
      are extremely expert in climbing, and can reach the top of
      the largest forest-trees without the aid of branches; they
      effect this by means of a small sharp flint, which they clasp
      tightly in the ball of their four fingers, and having cut a
      notch out of the bark, they easily ascend, with the large toe
      of each foot in one notch, and their curiously manufactured
      hatchet in the other. Their weapons of defence are the spear
      and waddie; the former is about twelve feet long, and as
      thick as the little finger of a man; the tea-tree supplies
      them with this matchless weapon; they harden one end, which
      is very sharply pointed, by burning and filing it with a
      flint prepared for the purpose. In throwing the spear they
      are very expert; indeed, of late, their audacious atrocities
      have been lamentably great, although, at the same time, I
      have little hesitation in saying, they have arisen from the
      cruel treatment experienced by some of their women from the
      hands of the distant stock-keepers. Indeed, these poor
      mortals, I know, have been shot at merely to gratify a most
      barbarous cruelty....
    </p>
    <p>
      After killing a white man, the natives have a sort of dance
      and rejoicing, jumping, and singing, and sending forth the
      strangest noises ever heard. They do not molest the body when
      dead, nor have I ever heard of their stripping or robbing the
      deceased. Among themselves they have no funeral rites; and
      those who are aged or diseased are left in hollow trees, or
      under the ledges of rocks, to pine and die. These people are
      subject to a disease, which causes the most loathsome
      ulcerated sores; two or three whom I saw were
      wretched-looking objects. I remember a very old man, who was
      thus affected, being tried and hung, for spearing one of Mr.
      Hart's men; the culprit was so ill and infirm as to be
      obliged to be carried to the place of execution. I think the
      colonial surgeons call the disease the "bush scab;" and that
      it is occasioned by a filthy mode of life. The population of
      natives is very small in proportion to the extent of the
      island: several causes may be alleged for their smallness of
      numbers; the principal one is their having been driven about
      from place to place, by settlers taking new locations;
      another cause is the great destruction of the kangaroo, which
      obliges the natives to labour hard to procure food sufficient
      for their sustenance: this, and their having no means of
      procuring vegetables, besides being constantly exposed to the
      weather, together with their offensive habits of living,
      produce the disease above mentioned, with its fatal
      consequences. <i>Widdowson's Van Dieman's Land</i>.

      Elihu Yale was remarkable for his auctions. The first of

      of goods from India, that, finding no one house large enough
      to stow them in, he had a public sale of the over-plus; and
      that was the first auction of the kind in England.

      While this impudent cheat is ridiculed for his absurdities,
      let him have credit for as lucky a guess as ever blessed the
      pages even of "Francis Moore, physician." In his
      "Astrologicall Predictions for 1648," there occurs the
      following passage, in which we must needs allow that he
      attained to "something like prophetic strain," when we call
      to mind that the great Plague of London occurred in 1665, and
      the great Fire in the year following:

      government, as never yet appeared; of which, as the times now
      stand, I have no liberty or encouragement to deliver any
      opinion. <i>Only, it will be ominous to London, unto her
      merchants at sea, to her traffique at land, to her poor, to
      her rich, to all sorts of people inhabiting in her or her
      liberties, BY REASON OF SUNDRY FIRES AND A CONSUMING
      PLAGUE."</i>

    <p>
      This is the prediction which, in 1666, led to his being
      examined by a Committee of the House of Commons; not, as has
      been supposed, that he might "discover by the stars who were
      the authors of the Fire of London," but because the precision
      with which he was thought to have foretold the event, gave
      birth to a suspicion that he was already acquainted with
      them, and privy to the (supposed) machinations which had
      brought about the catastrophe. Curran says, there are two
      kind of prophets, those who are really inspired, and those
      who prophesy events which they intend themselves to bring
      about. Upon this occasion, poor Lilly had the ill-luck to be
      deemed one of the latter class.

      Whenever these terms were first introduced, and whatever

      RELIC OF JOHN BUNYAN.

    <p>
      The cut represents the vessel from which John Bunyan, the
      author of that popular allegory, "the Pilgrim's Progress,"
      was accustomed to drink syllabub, during his incarceration in
      Bedford County Gaol. The original is in the possession of the
      correspondent who has furnished us with the sketch for the
      engraver. It is of common earthen-ware, 7-1/2 inches in
      height, and will contain 3-1/2 pints; one of the handles is
      partly broken off; the glaze is of a light flesh tint; and
      the vessel is a fair specimen of pottery in the early part of
      the seventeenth century.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bunyan, it will be recollected, was born in 1628, at Elstow,
      near Bedford, where the cottage stood in its original state
      till within these few years. It has latterly been new
      fronted, but the interior remains nearly as in Bunyan's time.
      He was the son of a tinker, and followed his father's trade;
      and at Elstow are the remains of a closet in which, in early
      life, he carried on business. During the civil war he served
      as a soldier in the parliament army; and subsequently joined
      a society of Anabaptists at Bedford, and became their public
      teacher. Soon after the Restoration, he was indicted for
      "abstaining from coming to church," and holding "unlawful
      meetings and conventicles," for which he was sentenced to
      transportation, which was not executed, as he was detained in
      prison upwards of twelve years, and at last liberated through
      the charitable interposition of Dr. Barlow, Bishop of
      Lincoln.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Richard Phillips, in his recent "Personal Tour," says,
      "on inquiring for relics of honest Bunyan, I was introduced
      to Mr. Hilyard, the present amiable and exemplary pastor of
      the large Independent Congregation, which 150 years since was
      under the spiritual care of Bunyan. Mr. H. at his
      meeting-house, showed me the vestry-chair of Bunyan; and the
      present pulpit is that in which Bunyan used to preach. At his
      own house he preserves the records of the establishment, many
      pages of which are in a neat and very scholastic hand by
      Bunyan, and contain many of his signatures."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bunyan's imprisonment gave rise to "The Pilgrim's Progress,"
      a work, which like "Robinson Crusoe," has remained unrivalled
      amidst a host of imitators. He was too, a wit as well as a
      preacher. Towards the close of his imprisonment a Quaker
      called on him, probably to make a convert of the author of
      the Pilgrim. He thus addressed him:&mdash;"Friend John, I am
      come to thee with a message from the Lord; and after having
      searched for thee in half the prisons in England, I am glad
      that I have found thee at last." "If the Lord had sent you,"
      sarcastically replied Bunyan, "you need not have taken so
      much pains, for the Lord knows that I have been a prisoner in
      Bedford Gaol for these twelve years past."

      SKELETON OF AN ELEPHANT.

    <p>
      The bones of poor Chunee, the stupendous elephant shot at
      Exeter 'Change, in 1826, have, at a considerable expense,
      been accurately articulated, and the entire skeleton is now
      exhibiting in one of the chambers at "the Egyptian Hall," in
      Piccadilly. We remember the interest, the "sensation," which
      the death of Chunee occasioned: it was a fertile
      incident&mdash;for we gave an engraving of the enormous
      deceased in his den at Exeter 'Change. It is little more than
      three years since, and probably in three years more, Chunee
      will figure in books of Natural History, and Exeter 'Change
      in the antiquarian's portfolio.

    <p>
      We recommend the Naturalist and all such as delight in
      contemplating sublime objects of nature, to see this
      skeleton; and there can scarcely be an exhibition better
      calculated to impress the youthful mind with the vastness of
      creation. It stands nearly 13 feet high, and the clear space
      beneath the ribs is 6 feet.

      EMIGRATION.

      <i>NEW COLONY ON SWAN RIVER</i>.
    </center>
    <p>
      We have abridged the following very important and interesting
      information respecting the New Settlement on the Western
      Coast of Australia, from the last Number of the <i>Quarterly
      Review</i>. The writer appears to have profited by access to
      official sources, and thus enhanced the value of his paper;
      but, disposed as we are, generally, to coincide with his
      views on the subject of <i>Emigration</i>, we do not think it
      necessary to detail them in this place. We have, however,
      retained the "Regulations," as issued from the Colonial
      Office, and made occasional quotations from Captain
      Stirling's Report; besides availing ourselves of a pamphlet
      lately published, entitled "Hints on Emigration to the New
      Settlement on the Swan and Canning
      Rivers."<a id="footnotetag2"
      name="footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a>
      The Report of Mr. Fraser, the government botanical surveyor,
      from Sydney, who accompanied Captain Stirling, is not so easy
      of access. The <i>Quarterly</i> writer, by some coincident
      opinions and references, appears to be acquainted with the
      above pamphlet, although it is not mentioned in the review.
      The official Regulations are as follow:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      1. His majesty's government do not intend to incur any
      <i>expense</i> in conveying settlers to the New Colony on the
      Swan River; and will not feel bound to defray the expense of
      supplying them with provisions or other necessaries, after
      their arrival there, nor to assist their removal to England,
      or elsewhere, should they be desirous of quitting the Colony.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      2. Such persons who may arrive in that settlement before the
      end of the year 1830, will receive, in the order of their
      arrival, grants of land, free of quit rent, proportioned to
      the capital which they may be prepared to invest in the
      improvement of the land, and of which capital they maybe able
      to produce satisfactory proofs to the Lieutenant Governor (or
      other officer administering the Colonial Government,) or to
      any two officers of the Local Government appointed by the
      Lieutenant Governor for that purpose, at the rate of forty
      acres for every sum of three pounds which they may be
      prepared so to invest.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      3. Under the head of investment of capital will be considered
      stock of every description, all implements of husbandry, and
      other articles which may be applicable to the purposes of
      productive industry, or which may be necessary for the
      establishment of the settler on the land where he is to be
      located. The amount of any half-pay or pension which the
      applicant may receive from Government, will also be
      considered as so much capital.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      4. Those who may incur the expense of taking out labouring
      persons, will be entitled to an allowance of land at the rate
      of fifteen pounds, that is, of two hundred acres of land, for
      the passage of every such labouring person, over and above
      any other investment of capital. In the class of "labouring
      persons," are included women, and children above ten years
      old. Provision will be made by law, at the earliest
      opportunity for rendering those capitalists, who may be
      engaged in taking out labouring persons to this settlement,
      liable for the future maintenance of those persons, should
      they, from infirmity, of any other cause, become unable to
      maintain themselves there.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      5. The license of occupation of land will be granted to the
      settler, on satisfactory proof being exhibited to the
      Lieutenant Governor (or other officer administering the Local
      Government,) of the amount of property brought into the
      colony. The proofs required of such property will be such
      satisfactory vouchers of expenses as would be received in
      auditing public accounts. But the full title to the land will
      not be granted in fee simple, until the settler has proved,
      (to the satisfaction of the Lieutenant Governor for other
      officer administering the Local Government,) that the sum
      required by Article 2 of these regulations (viz. one shilling
      and sixpence per acre) has been expended in the cultivation
      of the land, or in solid improvements, such as buildings,
      roads, or other works of the kind.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      6. Any grant of land thus allotted, of which a fair
      proportion, of at least one fourth, shall not have been
      brought into cultivation, otherwise improved or reclaimed
      from its wild state, to the extent of one shilling and
      sixpence per acre, to the satisfaction of the Local
      Government, within three years from the date of the license
      of occupation, shall, at the end of three years, be liable to
      a payment of sixpence per acre, into the public chest of the
      settlement; and, at the expiration of seven years more,
      should the land still remain in an uncultivated or unimproved
      state, it will revert absolutely to the crown.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      7. After the year 1830, land will be disposed of to those
      settlers who may resort to the colony, on such conditions as
      his Majesty's Government shall see occasion to adopt.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      8. It is not intended that any convicts, or other description
      of prisoners, be transported to this new settlement.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      9. The government will be administered by Captain Stirling,
      of the Royal Navy, as Lieut. Governor of the settlement; and
      it is proposed that a bill should be submitted to parliament,
      in the course of the next session, to make provision for the
      civil government of the New Settlement.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <i>Downing Street, 13th January, 1829</i>.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The intended settlement is designated, in the "Regulations,"
      as the "New Colony on the Swan River;"<a id="footnotetag3"
      name="footnotetag3"></a><a href="#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a>
      but this is a name, we think, not sufficiently comprehensive
      for the extent of territory meant to be occupied. What its
      future designation is meant to be, we pretend not to know,
      but if its soil should prove as fruitful as its climate is
      fine, the position and aspect of this part of the coast might
      justify the name of Southern, or Australian, <i>Hesperia</i>;
      under which might be included all that line of coast from
      Cape Leuwin, the southernmost point of New Holland, in lat.
      34 deg. 30 min., long. 115 deg. 12 min. east, to the lat. 31
      deg. (or a degree or two more northerly) long. 115 deg. 15
      min. east; and from the former point easterly to King
      George's Sound, where an English colony has already been
      established. This extent of territory, between the sea-coast
      and a range of mountains parallel to it, hereafter to be
      described, may be estimated
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page298" name="page298"></a>[pg
      298]</span> to contain from five to six millions of acres,
      the greater part of which, from the general appearance of the
      two extreme portions (the only ones examined) may be
      considered as land fit for the plough, and, therefore, fully
      capable of giving support to a million of souls. The
      description we are about to give of this territory is mainly
      derived from Captain Stirling, the intelligent officer who
      explored the country, and of which he has been appointed the
      Lieutenant Governor, and from Mr. Fraser, an excellent
      botanist, who accompanied him, and who was well acquainted
      with the soil and products of New South Wales, on the
      opposite side of Australia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Stirling, when commanding the Success frigate, was
      sent to New South Wales on a particular service, which the
      state of the monsoon prevented him from carrying into
      immediate execution. He determined, therefore, on the
      recommendation of General Darling, the governor, to explore,
      in the meantime, this western part of Australia, which was
      omitted to be surveyed by Captain King, on the ground that it
      had been <i>visited</i> by the French in the expedition of
      Captain Baudin: the result of that visit, however, is so
      unsatisfactory, and so very inaccurate, that we are rather
      surprised that Captain King should have passed over so
      interesting a portion, geographically considered, as the
      south-western angle of this great country. Captain Stirling
      arrived at Cape Leuwin on the 2nd of March, 1827, stood along
      the coast, and anchored in Gage's Roads, opposite Swan River,
      which he afterwards ascended to its source in boats, and sent
      out exploring parties to ascertain the nature of the
      surrounding territory.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We found," he says, "the country in general rich and
      romantic, gained the summit of the first range of mountains,
      and had a bird's-eye view of an immense plain, which extended
      as far as the eye could reach to the northward, southward,
      and westward. After ten days' absence, we returned to the
      ship; we encountered no difficulty that was not easily
      removable; we were furnished with abundance of fresh
      provisions by our guns, and met with no obstruction from the
      natives."
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Stirling describes the weather as very different from
      that which the French experienced; but the latter were on the
      coast at the commencement of the winter season. They were
      apparently so alarmed at the gales of wind, the rocks, and
      the reefs, and the banks, that they hastened to leave behind
      them this part of the coast unexamined, with all convenient
      speed. The strong westerly winds that prevail throughout the
      year in the southern ocean to the southward of the tropic,
      appear to assume a northern direction near this part of the
      Coast of Australia. These winds are here found to be cool and
      pleasant, and were generally accompanied by clear and serene
      weather. The summer winds from the N.W. are not infrequent;
      and, coming charged with moisture from a warm region into a
      colder one, they are invariably accompanied by rain; but, in
      the immediate vicinity of the shore, land and sea breezes are
      constant and regular. The climate appears to be delightful.
      While the Success was on the coast&mdash;that is, in the
      autumn&mdash;the average height of the thermometer was 72
      deg., the extremes being 84 deg. and 59 deg., the first
      occurring before the sea-breeze set in, the latter at
      midnight. The French found the temperature when at anchor, in
      June, from 14 deg. to 17 deg. of Reaumur, or 63 deg. to 70
      deg. of Fahrenheit. On the mountains, Captain Stirling says,
      the temperature appeared to be about 15 deg. below that of
      the plain. The alternate land and sea breezes create a
      moisture in the atmosphere which renders the climate cool and
      agreeable; the mornings and evenings are particularly so; and
      the nights are almost invariably brilliant and clear. Such a
      climate, it is almost unnecessary to say must be highly
      favourable to vegetation, which was accordingly observed to
      be most luxuriant. "The verdant appearance," says Captain
      Stirling, "and almost innumerable variety of grasses,
      herbaceous plants, shrubs, and trees, show that there is no
      deficiency in the three great sources of their sustenance,
      soil, heat, and moisture."
    </p>
    <p>
      The general structure and aspect of the country may be thus
      described:&mdash;from Cape Leuwin to Cape Naturaliste (the
      southern head of Baie G&eacute;ographe,) which is not quite a
      degree of latitude, the coast is formed of a range of hills,
      of uniform and moderate elevation. From Geographer's Bay to
      the northward of Swan River, the whole coast line is a
      limestone ridge, varying in height from twenty to six hundred
      feet, and extending inward to the distance of from one to
      five miles. Behind this ridge (whose occasional naked and
      barren appearance Captain Stirling also thinks may have
      caused the early and continued prejudice against the
      fertility of this western coast) commences a great plain,
      which occupies a space, from south to north, of undetermined
      length, (reaching, perhaps, to King George's Sound,) and
      varying, in breadth, from twenty to fifty miles. The eastern
      boundary of this plain skirts the base of an almost
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page299" name="page299"></a>[pg
      299]</span> continuous and abrupt chain of mountains, to
      which Captain Stirling gave the name of "General Darling's
      Range." One of the points, the highest seen and measured by
      him, was about three thousand feet high, The average height
      is stated to be from twelve hundred to fifteen hundred feet.
      The base is granite; the sides, in many parts, naked; and the
      soil supports but little vegetation, except the Stringy-bark
      and some hardy plants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Stirling observes, that coal was not found, because
      it was not particularly sought for; but he is of opinion that
      the general character of the country is such as to warrant
      the belief that it might be found; "for," he observes, "all
      the concomitant strata or members of the coal formation are
      exposed on different parts of the surface, below which I had
      no opportunity to explore. Indeed, the carboniferous order of
      locks is that which is most frequently exhibited throughout
      this territory; and I have no doubt important results would
      arise from a proper examination into its mineralogical
      resources."
    </p>
    <p>
      With reference to a supply of fresh water, so indispensably
      necessary in every settled country, the researches made by
      Captain Stirling and Mr. Fraser were attended with the most
      satisfactory results. The former observes, that the clouds
      which are impelled against the western side of the range of
      mountains are condensed into rain, the water of which is
      conducted across the plain to the sea, in numerous streams,
      but chiefly by three principal rivers, terminating in
      estuaries, or salt-water lakes. These are&mdash;the Swan
      River, opposite the Island Rottenest; the Rivi&egrave;re
      Vasse, and Port Leschenault, in Geographer's Bay. "We found,"
      says Captain Stirling, "a great number of creeks, or
      rivulets, falling into Swan River, more particularly on the
      eastern side; and I am inclined to think, that the country
      generally is much divided by such water-courses. Its supply
      of fresh water, from springs and lagoons, is abundant; for we
      found such wherever we thought it necessary to ascertain
      their existence. At Point Heathcote," he adds, "we met with a
      remarkable instance; for there the beach of a narrow rocky
      promontory is a bed of springs, and by tracing the finger
      along any part within four inches of the edge of the salt
      water, pure and fresh water instantly occupied the trace."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fraser's testimony leaves no doubt of the abundance of
      fresh water. "I was astonished," he says, "at the vivid green
      of the Eucalyptus, and other trees and shrubs, so distinct
      from those of New South Wales; but, on digging the soil to
      the depth of two feet, I found the cause to arise apparently
      from the immense number of springs with which this country
      abounds; for, at the depth above mentioned, I found the soil
      quite moist, although evidently at the latter end of an
      exceedingly dry season; and from the same cause must arise
      the great luxuriance of the herbaceous plants on the banks,
      which exceeds any thing I ever saw on the east coast. They
      consist principally of the <i>senecia</i> and the
      <i>sonchus</i>, which here attain the height of nine feet."
    </p>
    <p>
      He further observes, that numerous active springs issue from
      the rocks of the limestone ridge, and particularly in
      Geographer's Bay, the whole coast of which, he says, "is a
      perfect source of active springs, discharging themselves on
      the beach in rapid rills of considerable extent, every six or
      seven yards."
    </p>
    <p>
      Between the two heads which form the entrance into Swan
      River, there is, unfortunately, a bar, made by the continuity
      of the limestone ridge. Over this bar, the depth, at low
      water, is but six feet, and is therefore practicable only for
      boats or rafts. About a mile inside the heads, the water
      deepens; and then commences a succession of cliffs, or
      natural wharfs, with four, five, and six fathoms at their
      bases. The same depths are extended over a magnificent
      expanse of salt water, to which Captain Stirling has given
      the name of "Melville Water;" and which, in his opinion,
      wants only a good entrance to make it one of the finest
      harbours in the world, being seven or eight miles in length,
      by three or four in width, and having a depth of water from
      four to seven fathoms. This narrow entrance of the river, he
      thinks, might be made navigable by ships of burthen, without
      difficulty or great expense.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the town begins to rise, and substantial buildings are
      required, the blocks of stone procured by quarrying this
      entrance will go far towards paying the expense of
      excavation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Into this expansive sheet of water fall two rivers; one from
      the north-east, which is properly the Swan River; the other
      from the south-east, called Canning's River. Captain Stirling
      examined them both: the former to its source, the latter
      beyond the point where the water ceased to be brackish. They
      are both sufficiently convenient for boat navigation, even at
      the end of the dry season; and any obstruction might easily
      be removed to make them more so, by which the productions of
      an immense extent of country might be transported by
      water-carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page300" name="page300"></a>[pg
      300]</span> Mr. Fraser remarks that nothing of the mangrove
      appears along the banks of the Swan River, the usual
      situation of this plant being here occupied by the genus
      Metrosideros. The first plain, or flat, as it is called,
      contiguous to the river, commencing at Point Fraser, is
      formed of a rich soil, and appears, by a deposit of wreck, to
      be occasionally flooded to a certain extent. Here are several
      extensive salt marshes, which Mr. Fraser thinks are admirably
      adapted for the growth of cotton. The hills, though scanty of
      soil, are covered with an immense variety of plants; among
      others, a magnificent species of Angophera occupied the usual
      place of the Eucalyptus, which, however, here as on the
      eastern side, generally forms the principal feature in the
      botany of the country, accompanied by Mimosa, Correa,
      Melaleuca, Casuarina, Banksia, and Xanthorea. The brome, or
      kangaroo glass, was most abundant. On a more elevated flat, a
      little further up the river, the botanist observes that the
      "magnificence of the Banksia and arborescent Zamia, which was
      here seen thirty feet in height, added to the immense size of
      the Xanthorea near this spot, impart to the forest a
      character truly tropical." He says that about five miles to
      the eastward of the river, there is an evident change in the
      character of the country: extensive plains of the richest
      description, consisting of an alluvial deposit, equalling in
      fertility those of the banks of the River Hawkesbury in New
      South Wales, and covered with the most luxuriant brome grass.
      The Casuarina, so common near the limestone ridge of the
      coast, here disappears, and is succeeded by a pendulous
      species of Metrosideros, which continues to the source of the
      river.
    </p>
    <p>
      "From this point," says Mr. Fraser, "the country resembles,
      in every essential character, that of the banks of those
      rivers which fall to the westward of the Blue Mountains in
      New South Wales, varying alternately on each bank from hilly
      promontories of the finest red loam, and covered with
      stupendous Angopheras, to extensive flats of the finest
      description, studded with magnificent blue and water gums,
      and occasional stripes of Accacias and papilionaceous shrubs,
      resembling the green wattle of New South Wales."
    </p>
    <p>
      The higher the river is ascended, the more extended the flats
      become, and the better is the quality of the soil. Here the
      country is said to resemble in character that on the banks of
      the Macquarrie River, west of Wellington valley; and though
      marks of occasional floods appeared on the lower plains, the
      upper flats had evidently never been flooded. The sides of
      the mountains were bare of underwood, and their summits
      covered with large masses of iron stone, among which were
      growing enormous trees of Angophera, and some straggling
      plants of Hakea. On a careful examination of this part of the
      country bordering the two rivers from the sea-coast to the
      mountains, Mr. Fraser says, "In giving my opinion of the land
      seen on the banks of the Swan River, I hesitate not in
      pronouncing it superior to any I ever saw in New South Wales,
      east of the Blue Mountains, not only in its local character,
      but in the many existing advantages which it holds out to
      settlers. These advantages I consider to be,
    </p>
    <p>
      "First, the evident superiority of the soil.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Secondly, the facility with which a settler can bring his
      farm into a state of immediate culture, in consequence of the
      open state of the country, which allows not a greater average
      than two trees to an acre.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thirdly, the general abundance of springs, producing water
      of the best quality, and the consequent permanent humidity of
      the soil; two advantages not existing on the eastern coast.
      And,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fourthly, the advantages of water carriage to his door, and
      the non-existence of impediments to land carriage."

      ST. PAULS' CATHEDRAL.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Our readers are aware that the interior of the cupola of this
      magnificent cathedral, represents the life of St. Paul,
      painted by Sir James Thornhill; but the neglect and decay of
      this grand specimen of pictorial decoration may not be so
      well known. The great expense of erecting a scaffold
      sufficient for its restoration, appears to have been the
      principal difficulty, added to the want of artists
      experienced in this department of art. These obstacles,
      however, we trust have been surmounted by Mr. E.T. Parris, of
      whose talents we spoke in our account of the Colosseum, and
      who has just completed a model of an apparatus for getting at
      large domes. The model has already been approved by an
      experienced architect, and submitted to the dean and chapter
      of St. Paul's; so that the restoration of Sir James
      Thornhill's labours presents an excellent opportunity for the
      immediate application of Mr. Parris's machinery; whilst its
      accomplishment would be the means of rewarding individual
      ingenuity, and rescuing from decay a valuable triumph of
      British genius.

      SCOTTISH INNS.
    </h3>
    <p>
      <i>By Sir Walter Scott</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The courtesy of an invitation to partake a traveller's meal,
      or at least that of being invited to share whatever liquor
      the guest called for, was expected by certain old landlords
      in Scotland, even in the youth of the author. In requital,
      mine host was always furnished with the news of the country,
      and was probably a little of a humourist to boot. The
      devolution of the whole actual business and drudgery of the
      inn upon the poor gudewife was very common among the Scottish
      bonifaces. There was in ancient times, in the city of
      Edinburgh, a gentleman of good family, who condescended, in
      order to gain a livelihood, to become the nominal keeper of a
      coffee-house, one of the first places of the kind which had
      been opened in the Scottish metropolis. As usual, it was
      entirely managed by the careful and industrious Mrs.
      B&mdash;&mdash;; while her husband amused himself with
      field-sports, without troubling his head about the matter.
      Once upon a time the premises having taken fire, the husband
      was met walking up the High Street, loaded with his guns and
      fishing-rods, and replied calmly to some one that inquired
      after his wife, "that the poor woman was trying to save a
      parcel of crockery, and some trumpery books;" the last being
      those which served her to conduct the business of the house.
      There were many elderly gentlemen in the author's younger
      days, who still held it part of the amusement of a journey
      "to parley with mine host," who often resembled, in his
      quaint humour, mine Host of the Garter, in the Merry Wives of
      Windsor; or Blague of the George, in the Merry Devil of
      Edmonton. Sometimes the landlady took her share of
      entertaining the company. In either case, the omitting to pay
      them due attention gave displeasure, and perhaps brought down
      a smart jest, as on the following occasion:&mdash;A jolly
      dame who, not "sixty years since," kept the principal
      caravansary at Greenlaw, in Berwickshire, had the honour to
      receive under her roof a very worthy clergyman, with three
      sons of the same profession, each having a cure of souls; be
      it said in passing, none of the reverend party were reckoned
      powerful in the pulpit. After dinner was over, the worthy
      senior, in the pride of his heart, asked Mrs. Buchan whether
      she ever had had such a party in her house before. "Here sit
      I," he said, "a placed minister of the kirk of Scotland, and
      here sit my three sons, each a placed minister of the same
      kirk.&mdash;Confess, Luckie Buchan, you never had such a
      party in your house before." The question was not premised by
      any invitation to sit down and take a glass of wine or the
      like, so Mrs. B. answered drily, "Indeed, sir, I cannot just
      say that ever I had such a party in my house before, except
      once in the forty-five, when I had a Highland piper here,
      with his three sons, all Highland pipers; <i>and deil a
      spring they could play amang them!"&mdash;Notes to the New

      CATCHING TIGERS.
    </h3>
    <p>
      In some parts of South America, a great many tigers are
      caught with the lasso by the Indian and Creole inhabitants
      for the sake of their skins. They are also sometimes
      entrapped in the following manner: a large chest, or wooden
      frame, is made, supported upon four wheels, and is dragged by
      oxen to a place where the traces of tigers have been
      discovered. In the furthest corner of the chest is put a
      putrid piece of flesh, by way of bait, which is no sooner
      laid hold of by the tiger than the door of the trap falls; he
      is killed by a musket ball, or a spear thrust through the
      crevices of the planks.&mdash;<i>Memoirs of General

      it might at least be regulated, and a shooting license
      regularly taken out every year; and the licenses only granted
      to persons of a certain rank, and property, and age. Say, for
      instance, that none under fifteen years shall be allowed a
      license; that livery servants, apprentices, clerks in
      counting-houses, coach and wagon offices, hair-dressers, and
      tailors who use the thimble in person, should be considered
      as unqualified persons. This would render duelling more

      SOUTH AMERICAN BANDITTI.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The vicinity of Lima is occasionally infested by banditti,
      carrying on their operations in open day with so much system,
      that all who chance to travel at that time are sure to be
      relieved of their valuables. These robbers are composed
      chiefly of free mulattoes and others of a mixed race. The
      evil has existed from time immemorial, and is of purely
      Spanish origin; for Indian honesty, in retired villages, is
      so great, that when a family for a time leaves its cage-like
      hut, the latchless wicket is left ajar; a brush is placed on
      the sill, and it would be worse than sacrilege for any one to
      cross the threshold under any pretence. It has happened that
      the brigands, well armed and well mounted, have assembled at
      distant and uncertain periods within a mile of Callao. They
      direct their course towards Lima, stop all whom they meet,
      and having very civilly lightened them of their purses,
      oblige the plundered persons to accompany the robbers, till
      all arrive near to the city gate, when the banditti disperse.
      Some ride boldly into the town; many conceal themselves in
      the thickets of canes; whilst others cut across the country,
      and return quietly to their homes, to enjoy the spoil, or
      follow their usual occupations. The banditti, on such
      extraordinary occasions, amount to twenty or thirty in
      number; and it has happened that they have had about twenty
      carriages, besides persons dismounted and made to lead their
      own horses, in the train, which was regularly brought up by a
      rear-guard, while the advanced scouts pushed on to secure
      fresh booty. They seldom commit murder; and whenever it is
      possible, they avoid robbing officers of the army, or
      civilians in the employment of government. Neither do they,
      when acting in small parties, attack persons of note.
      Foreigners and strangers are in general their usual
      victims.&mdash;<i>Memoir of General Miller</i>.

      STEALING A SHEET.
    </h3>
    <p>
      A bet was laid by a gentleman that he would procure an Indian
      thief who should steal the sheet from under a person without
      waking him. The thing was effected in the following
      manner:&mdash;the Bheel approaching the person, who lay on
      his side, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page303"
      name="page303"></a>[pg 303]</span> from behind, carefully
      folded up the sheet in small compact plaits till it reached
      his back; then, taking a feather, he tickled the nose of the
      sleeper, who immediately scratched his face and rolled over
      on the other side, when with a slight effort he completely
      released the sheet, and bore it off in
      triumph.&mdash;<i>Twelve Years' Military Adventures</i>.

    <h3>
      EDUCATION AND AMUSEMENTS OF THE LOWER CLASSES.
    </h3>
    <p>
      A correspondent of the <i>Gardener's Magazine</i> observes
      that "next to the existing school societies, there is
      nothing I am more anxious to see, or would more gladly
      contribute to, than a <i>Society for promoting the Rational
      Amusements of the Lower Classes</i>, the first aim of which
      should be to instruct itinerant teachers of music, singing,
      and dancing, in improved modes of imparting their arts, and
      thus fairly set the plan agoing, when it would soon work its
      own way, and might then be extended to higher objects. The
      taste for flowers among the Paisley weavers, for
      gooseberry-growing at Manchester, and for music among the
      west of Yorkshire clothiers, originally sprang up from
      imitation of one or two amateurs of each pursuit; and there
      only needs a similar <i>first impulse</i>, which a society
      with a few thousands a year might give, to spread a general
      taste for music, singing, and dancing, and ultimately for
      other branches of the fine arts, as drawing and painting, as
      well as for natural history, and the cultivation of flowers
      and fruits, &amp;c.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The lower classes in England, thus improved in morals and
      manners by a better education and more humanising amusements,
      might be safely left to choose their time of contracting
      marriage, and would then no more make beasts of themselves by
      drinking fermented liquors, than do the lower classes in the
      city from which I write, (Brussels) where probably more beer
      (and that by no means weak) is drank than in any town of
      similar size in England, every street being crowded with
      <i>cabarets</i> (public-houses,) and these in the evening
      almost always filled. But how filled? Not with rioters and
      noisy drunkards, but with parties at separate tables, often
      consisting of a man, his wife and children, all sipping their
      pot of beer poured into very small glasses to prolong the
      pleasure, and the gratification of drinking seeming less than
      that of the cheerful chit-chat, which is the main object of
      the whole assemblage. Deep-rooted national bad habits can be
      eradicated only by the spread of knowledge, which will
      ultimately teach our lower classes, as it has already done
      the bulk of the higher, that <i>moderation</i> is the
      condition of real enjoyments, and must be the motto even of
      the sensualist who aims at long-continued indulgence."

      The great Duke of Marlborough, who was, perhaps, the most
      accomplished gentleman of his age, would never suffer any
      approaches to obscenity in his presence; and it was said, by
      Lord Cobham, that he did not reprove it as an immorality in
      the speaker, but resented it as an indignity to himself; and
      it is evident, that to speak evil of the absent, to utter
      lewdness, blasphemy, or treason, must degrade not only him
      who speaks, but those who hear; for surely that dignity of
      character, which a man ought always to sustain, is in danger,
      when he is made the confidant of treachery, detraction,
      impiety, or lust; for he who in conversation displays his own
      vices, imputes them; as he who boasts of a robbery to
      another, presupposes that he is a

<p>Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.</p>

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://gutenberg.net/license">http://gutenberg.net/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06">http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
